# credit-card-fraud-detection
The goal of this project is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning. Since fraud cases are rare in real-world transactions, handling imbalanced data is a major challenge. The project focuses on data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to build a robust fraud detectionÂ system.
